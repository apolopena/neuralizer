# TASKS.md Template — Running Ledger

## Update Instructions (for `/execute-prp` workflow)

**When starting PRP execution:**
1. If `.ai/TASKS.md` doesn't exist, copy this template to that location
2. Add the PRP item to "In Progress" section (between the HTML markers)
3. Keep only ONE item in "In Progress" at a time

**When completing PRP execution:**
1. Move the item from "In Progress" to "Done" section (between the HTML markers)
2. Format: `- [x] WP-ID: Short title (YYYY-MM-DD) - brief summary of what was delivered`
3. Replace "In Progress" content with `- *(empty)*` after moving item to Done
4. When task completes, move it to Done or archive to dated file to keep ledger clean

## Template Structure

Use this structure for your work ledger. Keep entries concise and ensure the file stays accurate at all times.

### In Progress
Active work (only ONE item at a time). Add item when starting PRP execution.
<!-- IN_PROGRESS_START -->
- *(empty)*
<!-- IN_PROGRESS_END -->

### Done
Completed tasks with brief summary. Move from In Progress when work complete.
<!-- DONE_START -->
- *(empty)*
<!-- DONE_END -->

### Abandoned
Tasks that are no longer needed or relevant. Move here instead of deleting.
- *(empty)*
