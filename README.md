## About

NeurALIzer strips sensitive information from prompts, logs, and shell commands before they reach an LLM. Passwords, API keys, tokens, IP addresses, and other PII are detected and replaced with safe placeholders — so you can feed real operational data into AI workflows without leaking secrets.
